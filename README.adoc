= Java syslog-relp Developer Example

== Overview
Java syslog-RELP Developer Example project guides through design considerations with an actual example. The example uses https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5424[syslog] with Reliable Event Logging Protocol (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliable_Event_Logging_Protocol[RELP]) in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)[Java] programming language. 

The project also utilizes Teragrep Java RELP Library (https://github.com/teragrep/rlp_01[rlp_01]). Rlp_01 ensures reliable record processing in Java applications. It uses optional https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security[TLS] encryption and public-key https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate[certificate] verification.

== Background
Syslog is a record format standard for message logging. It allows separation of: 

* the software that produces message records, 
* the system that stores them, and 
* the software that reports and analyzes them.

When you use syslog as a record format, you can ensure the produced records are accessible. 

RELP is a transport protocol. It allows reliable, encrypted and robust transmission of syslog records. With RELP, you can integrate with many syslog based systems. The mechanism is reliable for transporting the syslog messages over network.

Syslog and RELP allow a real-time record streaming, from an application to an archival and analytics system. Take https://github.com/teragrep/teragrep/[Teragrep] as an example.

=== Example about application logging

Application is producing many record streams containing valuable information about:

* requests, including transaction processing
* authentication
* authorization
* session handling
* functional errors
* technical errors
* debugging
* runtime metric data

All these are separate record streams from a single application. The application could, for example, handle web-shop orders.

Syslog record format allows capturing all these into their own streams. Meanwhile, the origin of the information is kept in the record metadata.

As seen above, syslog is able to capture all information. At the same time, the payload part of the record keeps information as human-readable. Delivery and retention of this kind of information is essential for the business.

By following this guide, you can ensure that records:

* are handled in a proper manner, 
* contain essential metadata and 
* are delivered without loss and in real-time from the application for further processing.

== Ready-Made Application Integrations for Syslog-RELP

For logging use, teragrep ships following libraries which can be used as part of the relevant logging framework:

* Logback https://github.com/teragrep/jla_01[Relp Logging plugin for Logback]
* Java Util Logging (JUL) https://github.com/teragrep/jla_04[Java Util Logging RELP Handler]
* Log4j 1.x https://github.com/teragrep/jla_05[Log4j RELP Plugin]
* Log4j 2.x https://github.com/teragrep/jla_06[Log4j2 RELP Plugin]

They integrate natively with their relevant logging framework by extending the existing capabilities.

NOTE: Ready made libraries work well for the logging use, however for other type of integrations, more control over the syslog record metadata and RELP protocol may be necessary, i.e. to be able to set the timestamp or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier[uuid] of the record being transmitted. For this, see next section.

== Syslog-RELP Integration Guidelines

=== Syslog
==== Headers
* Wrap messages in syslog envelope
* syslog-hostname must be configurable
* syslog app-name must be configurable

NOTE: sharing same syslog-hostname and syslog-app names allow parallel deployments of the application to share the same processing rules

[source,java]
----
// see SyslogRecordTest.java
----

==== Structured-data
* include origin data in syslog structure-data
* include original uuid in syslog structured-data

NOTE: structured-data is a managed schema, adding new fields with our https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_enterprise_number[48577] is not a good idea

[source,java]
----
// see SyslogRecordWithSDTest.java
----

=== RELP

==== Non-functional requirements
* Retry indefinitely and do not lose messages
* Processing must not hang indefinitely due to technical issues but rather retry new connection

[source,java]

// see CompleteExampleTest.java

RELP TLS
See https://github.com/teragrep/rlp_03/blob/main/src/test/java/com/teragrep/rlp_03/TlsClientTest.java[TlsClientTest.java] on rlp_03 repository.

== General
=== Testing
* test cases must be executable

=== Logging
* errors (executions) must not be hidden

=== Configuration
* server port needs to be configurable
* server address needs to be configurable
